      "Outsource non-critical tasks": "Ferriss advocates for the use of virtual assistants and other forms of outsourcing to handle routine, non-critical tasks. This allows you to focus your energy and attention on high-value tasks that truly require your expertise.",
      "Leverage the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) in life and work": "According to Ferriss, 80% of the results often come from 20% of the efforts. Identifying and focusing on these high-impact efforts can greatly increase productivity.",
      "Cultivate selective ignorance to focus on important things": "Rather than trying to consume all information that comes your way, Ferriss suggests practicing selective ignorance by intentionally ignoring or avoiding information that isn't useful or relevant to your goals.",
      "Use 'batching' to increase productivity": "Ferriss recommends grouping similar tasks together (batching) and completing them all at once to improve efficiency and productivity."

      "Focus on validated learning over traditional success metrics": "Ries argues that startups should focus on learning what their customers actually want, rather than traditional business metrics like revenue and market share."
